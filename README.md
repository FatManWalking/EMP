# EMNLP-project

Project for the 2022 Summer Semester Course Empirical Methods in NLP and Data Science

## Description

In this project we analyse the Hierarchical Graph Pooling with structured
learning by Zhang on its performance on different datasets and analyse properties
of these dataset to make claims on where the proposed architecture does better or
worse than a simpler counterpart.

For this different empirical tests are conducted to show validity, reliability and significance of the model (performance) and dataset. More about this can be found in Riezler, S., & Hagmann, M. (2022). Validity, Reliability, and Significance: Empirical Methods for NLP and Data Science. Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 14(6), 1â€“147. https://doi.org/10.2200/S01137ED1V01Y202110HLT055

## Installation
